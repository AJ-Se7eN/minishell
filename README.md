# minishell
Shell for UnixðŸ‘¹

## About

Minishell is the project of the school21.
It's a minimum viable version of a real shell.
The main goal is to have a good understanding of process creation and
synchronisation using the C programmming language.

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
The only requirements are:
- GNU make (v3.81)
- GCC (v4.2.1)

Those versions are the ones used during development.

### Building the program

1. Download/Clone this repo

        git clone https://github.com/kylr42/minishell
2. `cd` into the root directory and run `make`

        cd minishell
        make

### Running the program

After building the source, run `./minishell` from the project root.

## Main Project Instructions

### Available options

Minishell runs executables from an absolute, relative or environment PATH (``/bin/ls`` or ``ls``), including arguments or options. ``'`` and ``"`` work the same as bash, except for multiline commands.

You can separate commands with ``;``, as well as use redirections ``>`` ``>>`` ``<`` and pipes ``|``.

Environment variables are handled, like ``$HOME``, including the return code ``$?``.

Finally, you can use ``Ctrl-C`` to interrupt and ``Ctrl-\`` to quit a program, as well as ``Ctrl-D`` to throw an EOF, same as in bash.

A few of the functions are "built-in", meaning we don't call the executable, we re-coded them directly. It's the case for ``echo``, ``pwd``, ``cd``, ``env``, ``export``, ``unset`` and ``exit``.
